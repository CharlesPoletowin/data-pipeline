This is the project Data Pipeline in INESA.

1. Since we find it polyaxon in Kubernetes doesn't have source code, we try sth else instead.

2. We find it difficult to install kubeflow in the situation that we could not visit google

3. We find Airflow could not run successfully in this kubernetes

4. Now we try to use MLFlow instead.

5. We found it almost impossible to install it in kubernetes successfully, so we try to install and use it in Ubuntu directly. Finally, this project has been terminated.
